## Project Overview

NeedARoomie is a production-grade web platform that streamlines room and roommate discovery for students and working professionals. The system addresses critical pain points in the rental market—fragmented listings, trust issues, and verification gaps—through location-aware search, authenticated user profiles, and structured matching algorithms.

**Timeline:** October 2025  
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer  
**Status:** Live Production

### Platform Architecture

The platform implements two distinct user workflows: room discovery and listing management. Both are supported by secure authentication layers, usage-based access controls, and a scalable backend infrastructure optimized for mobile-first interactions.

---

## Challenge

The current rental discovery process presents significant operational friction:

**Fragmented Information Flow**  
Listings scattered across WhatsApp groups, broker networks, and generic real-estate platforms create information silos and inefficient search processes.

**Verification Gap**  
Absence of standardized verification mechanisms results in high spam rates and fraudulent listings, eroding platform trust.

**Poor Mobile Experience**  
Existing solutions lack mobile-optimized interfaces, critical for the target demographic of students and first-time renters.

**Compatibility Matching**  
No systematic approach to filter by organizational affiliation, lifestyle preferences, or compatibility metrics.

## Solution Architecture

### Dual User Workflow System

**Room Discovery Flow**  
Users initiate searches via Google Places Autocomplete with location-aware filtering. Results display as structured cards containing rental details, tenant information, and cost breakdowns. Advanced filters support organization-specific searches and preference matching.

**Listing Management Flow**  
Authenticated users access a dashboard interface for posting room listings with structured data fields: rent, deposit, occupancy rules, gender preferences, and tenant profiles. All listings support image uploads and real-time editing capabilities.

### Authentication & Security Layer

**Multi-Factor Verification**
- Google OAuth integration for streamlined authentication
- Phone number verification via Firebase to prevent account abuse
- Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

**Data Access Control**  
Row-level policies ensure users can only access and modify their own data, eliminating the need for complex permission logic at the application layer.

### Freemium Access Control

**Usage-Based Tier System**  
Free, Basic, and Premium tiers with server-enforced limits on:
- Active listing slots
- Room view quotas
- Roommate profile access

Backend tracking prevents client-side limit bypassing, ensuring monetization integrity.

### Location Intelligence

**Geographic Search System**
- Google Maps & Places API for address validation
- Latitude/longitude storage for each listing
- Distance-based filtering for proximity search
- Neighborhood and organization-specific discovery

### UI/UX Implementation

**Design Principles**
- Dark-first minimal interface with theme toggle
- Floating navigation with smooth state transitions
- Motion-enhanced interactions for engagement
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for iOS Safari
- Reduced animation for users with motion sensitivity preferences

### Performance Optimization

**Technical Optimizations**
- Query optimization with pagination and lazy loading
- Image compression and adaptive loading for bandwidth efficiency
- Environment-based configuration for secure API key management
- Server-side rendering for improved initial load times

## Outcomes & Impact

### Product Development

Delivered a production-ready SaaS platform encompassing UX design, backend architecture, security implementation, and monetization strategy from initial concept to market launch.

### Security Architecture

Implemented Row Level Security policies for automated data isolation, eliminating complex authorization logic while maintaining strict data access controls.

### Scalability Design

Architected system to balance free-tier operational constraints with horizontal scalability requirements, enabling future growth without infrastructure redesign.

### Extension Opportunities

Platform architecture supports expansion into:
- University housing management portals
- Corporate relocation assistance programs
- City-specific rental marketplace ecosystems

## Project Differentiation

**Production-Grade Implementation**  
Built for real users with real constraints, incorporating monetization strategy, abuse prevention mechanisms, and pricing logic from day one.

**Beyond CRUD Operations**  
Comprehensive feature set including authentication strategy, usage tracking, automated email workflows, and UX polish typically absent from prototype projects.

**Engineering Discipline**  
Production-minded architectural decisions prioritizing maintainability, security, and scalability over rapid prototyping shortcuts.
