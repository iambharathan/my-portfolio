## Overview

NeedARoomie is a full-stack web platform designed to simplify how students and working professionals find rooms and compatible roommates. The product focuses on real-world rental pain points—scattered listings, poor trust signals, and spam—by combining location-aware search, verified users, and structured roommate profiles in a clean, mobile-first experience.

The platform supports two primary user journeys: **finding a room** and **listing a room**, backed by secure authentication, usage-based access controls, and a scalable backend. The UI prioritizes speed, clarity, and smooth motion, with careful optimization for mobile devices (especially iPhones).

## Problem Statement

Finding a room or roommate in a new city is often chaotic:

- **Listings are spread** across WhatsApp groups, brokers, and generic real-estate sites
- **No reliable way to filter** by organization, lifestyle, or compatibility
- **High spam and fake listings** due to weak verification
- **Poor mobile UX** for students and first-time renters

NeedARoomie was built to solve these problems with a **trust-first, user-centric platform**.

## Core Features

### Dual User Flows – Find or List

#### Find Room Flow
Users search by location using Google Places Autocomplete, filter listings by rent, preferences, and organization, and view detailed room cards with images, tenant info, and cost breakdowns.

#### List Room Flow
Authenticated users can post room listings with structured details such as rent, deposit, conditions, gender preference, and current tenants. Listings are manageable through a dedicated dashboard.

### Secure Authentication & Verification

- **Google OAuth** for frictionless sign-in
- **Phone number verification** to reduce fake accounts and free-plan abuse
- **Supabase Auth + Row Level Security (RLS)** to ensure users can only access their own data

### Usage-Based Access Control (Freemium Model)

Free, Basic, and Premium plans with enforced limits on:

- Live listings
- Room views
- Roommate profile views

Limits are tracked at the backend level to prevent client-side bypassing.

### Location-Aware Search

- **Google Maps & Places API** for accurate address selection
- **Latitude/longitude stored** for each listing
- **Nearby room discovery** with distance-based filtering

### Modern UI/UX

- Minimal, dark-first design with **light/dark mode toggle**
- **Floating navigation bar** with smooth transitions
- **Motion-enhanced interactions** inspired by modern SaaS design
- Fully responsive and optimized for **mobile and iPhone Safari**

### Performance & Reliability

- Optimized queries with **pagination and lazy loading**
- **Image optimization** for low bandwidth usage
- Environment-based configuration for secure API handling

## Impact & Learnings

✅ **Designed a real-world SaaS product from scratch**, covering UX, backend architecture, security, and monetization

✅ **Implemented Row Level Security** to enforce data isolation without complex backend logic

✅ **Learned to balance free-tier constraints** with scalable architecture decisions

✅ **Built a platform that can be extended to:**
- University housing portals
- Corporate relocation support
- City-specific rental ecosystems

## What Makes This Project Stand Out

🚀 **Real users, real constraints, real monetization thinking**

🎯 **Not just CRUD** — includes auth strategy, abuse prevention, pricing logic, and UX polish

⚡ **Production-minded decisions** rather than hackathon shortcuts
